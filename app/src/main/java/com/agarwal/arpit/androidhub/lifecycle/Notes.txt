Notes on Activity lifecycle

1. Callback methods in-order while activity creation :
onCreate()
onStart()
OnRestoreSavedInstance()
onPostCreate()
onResume()
onPostResume()
onAttachedToWindow()
onPause()
onStop()
onSaveInstanceState()
onDestroy()

2. ConfigChange like rotate screen , switching back and forth to Multi-window
onPause -> onStop -> onSaveInstanceState -> onDestroy -> onCreate -> onStart -> onRestoreInstanceState -> onPostCreate ->
-> onResume -> onPostResume -> onAttachedToWindow

3. Selecting focus between multi-window app
onPause -> onResume -> onPostResume (onAttachedToWindow NOT CALLED THIS TIME)

4. Recent apps screen
onPause -> onStop -> onSaveInstanceState -> onStart -> onResume -> onPostResume

5. Switching to another activity (A->C )
onPause (A) -> onCreate -> onStart -> onPostCreate -> onResume -> onPostResume -> onAttachedToWindow -> onStop(A) -> onSaveInstanceState(A)

6. User taps Back button
By default, the onSaveInstanceState() callback does not fire in this case override onBackPressed() to customise the behaviour like confirm-quit

7. finish() from ActivityC to ActivityA
onPause (C) ->  onStart -> onResume -> onPostResume  -> onStop(C) -> onDestroy(C)  ( onSaveInstanceState(C) not called )



Notes on Fragment lifecycle
onAttach()
onCreateView()
onViewCreated()
onActivityCreated()
onViewStateRestored()
onStart()
onResume()
onPause()
onStop()
onSaveInstanceState()
onDestroyView()
onDestroy()
onDetach()

1. Attaching the fragment
onAttach -> onCreate ->  onCreateView ->   onViewCreated ->  onActivityCreated ->  onViewStateRestored ->  onStart ->  onResume
-> onPause(->onResume) -> onStop(->onStart) -> onDestroyView(->onCreateView) -> onDestroy(->onCreate) -> onDetach(->onAttach)

2. Fragment is getting destroyed
onPause -> onStop -> onDestroyView -> onDestroy -> onDetach

3.Recent apps screen
onPause -> onStop -> onSaveInstanceState

4. Config change
Fragment is destroyed and added once again just like activity

5. Selecting focus between multi-window app
onPause -> onResume

6. Important Notes
    a. Fragment can also be added via xml (statically)
    b. Activity adding fragment dynamically should have a container for it
    c. For inter-fragment communication send data via parent Activity (no direct communication b/w fragments)
    d. For sending data implement Interface in Activity which will send implementation to fragments and receive data .
    e. interfaces are initialised in onAttach of fragment
